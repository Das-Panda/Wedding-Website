</b>Sitting at home after work one evening during Christmas, I was surfing  the internet as I usually do. As many people my age have, one of the  open tab's on my internet browser was FB. I decided to do a search of  people whom I might have gone to school with and reunite with on the  popular networking site. I soon came across a young woman's profile who  looked like she might be fun and interesting to talk to. I sent her a  friend request and a few days later I received a message asking how we  knew each other, more than just being in the same school. I had to come  up with something quickly in order to not sound like some sort of  internet stalker. I said we might have said "Hi" in passing. In high  school I was known by most people but didn't interact with many. A  simple "Hi" in passing was a usual thing for me to do. She accepted her  new found friend and over time we talked off and on both on the internet  and over the phone. Fridays were our time to talk, after a long week I  like to relax by having a cigar at the local tobacco shop.&nbsp; It just so  happen that at this same time a few states away a young woman would be  heading back to her dorm from classes on the campus bus. Many times our  conversation would last longer than that little bus ride and go on for  hours. &nbsp;Our friendship continued to flourish over time. Meetings soon  came when she was in town. Despite the pizza incident my feelings for  her still grew. One day as I drove home from work Brittany called me;  this was unusual because it wasn't a pre arranged time to talk. She  asked me to go with her to her mother's wedding. While at that wedding  we couldn't stop staring at each other. Everyone could tell there was  some big spark between us. That night was one of the best nights of my  life - sitting on a little swing together talking and listening to the  waves on Lake Granbury crash against the shoreline. Our wedding day will  be the best day in my life.

During the Christmas break of my freshman year at the University of San Diego (2005), I had a friend request from a guy named Kenneth Struck. I had no idea who he was and only found that he has graduated from Creekview High School just as I did. Being cautious about who I friended on FB, I accepted with an attached message…something like, "Hey, did we ever have a class together at Creekview?" His response was something like this, "Well I don't think so but we said hi to each other in passing." Everyone who knows me, absolutely knows I DO NOT just say hi to people "in passing". I try and make every friendship more than just "in passing". We continued our FB friendship with messages back and forth mainly around Christmas time and birthdays for the next two years, until I wanted to meet him in person at the end of Summer 2007. We met at his favorite pizza place, Joe's Subs and Pizza in Carrollton, Texas. I managed to knock over his drink with my purse all over his just delivered cheese pizza! Why did this happen? He didn't want to lean in his 50% for a first meeting friend hug! We remained good friends after that and continued to keep in touch on FB. As my junior year of college was ending, I needed a local date to my Mother's wedding so I asked Kenneth to attend the wedding with me as my friend. By the end of that weekend, I knew deep down somewhere this was the man God intended for me to be with. Kenneth and I had a wonderful Summer 2008 together as I worked in Galveston, TX for the government – he drove down every weekend from Dallas to spend time with me and the seaweed (he hates seaweed)! Our anniversary is June 14, 2008.
