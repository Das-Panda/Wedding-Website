<td width="78%" valign="top"><b>Kristen </b>- <i>Matron of honor, best friend for 
life:</i> I have known Kristen since we were about 5 years old when we met in a school program called "Mother's Day Out" at Carrollton Christian Academy. We initially hated each other as little girls and had to pretend to like each other when the school photographer took a picture of us on the playground… forced to hug by the slide (Kristen's mom has the newspaper article). We did the multiple night slumber parties (Friday night, Saturday night) all throughout grade school and middle school either at my house or hers. We shared our sixteenth birthdays together and were surprised by both of our families who had planned a country and western dance party out in the middle of nowhere! Kristen started driving before me, so we have many memories of going to the movie theaters and malls ourselves all on our own! Although we went to separate high schools, we still remained close, even when she finished her senior year in Tennessee - I was so excited to be there for her graduation! College took me even further away from her and my trips to see her became less even non-existent except for holidays/July 4ths when we both happened to be in Dallas at the same time. Kristen never judged me or got upset with me for not calling and catching up as often as best friends should – she accepts me and all my faults. Kristen has such a big heart for her family and serves as a great role model, especially for her younger sister, brother, and cousin, Ron.

Kristen knows my past in terms of school, play, and love and her support throughout all these years has kept me afloat spiritually and mentally. Her words of advice during some of the difficult times in my life were exactly what I needed to hear. She remains to be a woman I can trust, lean on, and confide in. Kristen and I have a special kind of friendship, the most unique of friendships really - a relationship that can survive the test of time and distance. We share some pretty amazing memories and I plan to make many many more as the years pass. She met Kenneth for the first time July 4th, 2008. Her support for the relationship Kenneth and I share means so much to me, and Kenneth and I constantly look up to her and her husband for an example of a forever kind of love.</td>

<td valign="top"><b>Emily</b> - <i>Maid of honor, best friend for 
life:</i> Emily was my first, favorite, and forever still in my heart, college roommate at the University of San Diego. We were in an all-girls dorm hall and we are the farthest thing from girly girls you typically find in a freshman dorm…far from the hair, make up, clothes, parties, drama, etc. Emily understood me and I understood her, which is rare to find in college! Since our University was small and private, the school sent out basic info about her before school started. Her birthday was the day before mine! Her parents and my parents had the same first names! It just kept getting better and better! When we met we clicked instantly. Emily supported my decision to join the crew team and for her that meant dealing with a roommate waking up at 4:30 every morning and the same roommate not showering on a regular bases – I have a really good defense for this behavior. What a trooper she was! Emily's house in Trabuco Canyon was my get-away for some weekends – her parents are so loving and accepting of me, as they made me feel like part of the family. Emily and I shared one Easter together where I learned how to decorate eggs for the first time in my life. We also shared a Thanksgiving dinner together one year as well where I experienced making bread stuffing. She was there for me during the hard, stressful times of college, and never stopped supporting me. I've learned so much from Emily – everything from learning to search better on Google to learning how to show my faith in the Lord to others. While working in Long Beach this past summer, Emily made time to visit me and keep me company/take me to the grocery store since I was car less. Although we share many things in common, Emily has a bigger heart than I do and puts others first before herself more frequently than I do. Emily met Kenneth for the first time during the fall of 2008, and Kenneth spent Christmas 2008 dinner with Emily and her family. She has continually supported my relationship with Kenneth and always provides me with sound advice when it comes to handling my relationship with Kenneth and my relationship with myself.</td>

<td width="78%" valign="top"><p><b>Tiffany </b>-<i> Bridesmaid, sister of the bride:</i> Tiffany is my older sister who has been with me through so many adventures of life. When we were little, I did steal all her clothes and tried to wear them to be cool like her. Many times I did get in trouble for this. As we grew up, she would share secrets of life with me (i.e. how boys acted and why), and let me listen to her CDs/borrow them if I asked nicely. Middle school was a pretty good time for me, partly because I had a "cool" older sister who was very popular, so I suppose I was popular by association. During most of my high school years, Tiffany was off at college and I would get stories from my mother about Tiffany losing her meal card or being locked out of the dorm room…I quickly took notes on what NOT to do in college. Taking trips to see Tiffany in college were really special for me – getting to see my sister in her college environment and sharing in her daily routine was a great experience and preparation for dorm life. As I started college, Tiffany made trips to see me during holidays and other times during the year as well, and getting to share that part of my life with her in San Diego was exciting for me. Tiffany is slightly messier than I am. Tiffany is a better runner/athlete than me. Tiffany communicates emotions and all things lovey dovey and I do not. Tiffany reads more/quicker than I do. Despite all of our differences, we have one common denominator: our desire to follow Christ in life, love, and play. Tiffany met Kenneth for the first time the weekend before my mother got married in June 2008. Her encouragement she provides for my relationship with Kenneth is a gift I do not take for granted.</p></td>

<td valign="top"><b>Lindsey</b> - <i>Bridesmaid, best friend for 
life:</i> Lindsey has been my housemate since I started my graduate school adventure in Rhode Island. The summer before classes started I did stalk her on FB and was initially scared because she had on her profile she didn't like Heracio from CSI: Miami! Once we met, we got this issue straightened out and it turns out she does enjoy the show and we both slightly enjoy making fun of it. I knew all things were going to go well soon after I found out that she is actually a NATIVE TEXAN, born not raised, but it still counts! Lindsey and I have very different personalities that really complement each other. She makes me laugh until I have to pee my pants, and she understand "Brittany Talk" (I say things wrong/out of order/wrong pronunciation/think out loud incomplete phrases and she somehow understands it). Lindsey and I have been through some pretty big whoppers in terms of dealing with a bad landlord, but it was ultimately Lindsey who found us a new, more happy home. Lindsey has opened up my world to so many new things: humus, Criminal Minds, spices, water filters, the History Channel, Ann Taylor Loft, White House/Black Market, and so many other treasures of life! We bond over Law and Order: SVU and wedding shows she has introduced me to. She has taught me a little more about fashion and how to incorporate some fun into grad life. She has been an amazing woman to get to know, as we continue to share stories about our families and past lives as silly undergraduates. What have we done? We have survived snow and ice days together, with only one shovel . We have seen too many episodes of SVU. We always buy too many groceries that somehow disappear in less than two weeks, and we have more recently taken up Hip Hop Abs which we love! Lindsey is more than a housemate to me. She is a friend who can share a bathroom with me, a friend who can find humor in any situation, and a friend who I can share private tidbits with. Lindsey met Kenneth during April 2009, and remains to be the only one who has to endure hearing the ins and outs/drama/issues of a long distance relationship. Her acceptance of me and how I handle my relationship with Kenneth being so far away is possibly the best blessing from above. If I can't keep Kenneth in line, she will (despite his constant bacon barrage)!</td>

<td width="78%" valign="top"><b>Daniel</b> - <i>Best Man, Tech 4 Unite:</i> Daniel and I went to middle school together but didn't really start to get to know each other until high school. Daniel and I started our friendship in tech theater; he was always the nerdy guy my inner geek wanted to be. I remember when class was about to start and Daniel would run in as he was on his laptop and programing his TI calculator at the same time. I always wanted to get into computers, but at home we were technically challenged. Over time I got more and more into computers and talked with Daniel to get his opinions about what equipment to buy. As time went on Daniel became a close friend. After high school Daniel moved up to Denton for college, as I stayed behind. I would go up to see him (and The Tomato) whenever I could, usually 4-5 times a semester. Although Daniel&rsquo;s free time has always been limited, he's made time to help me through big and small problems alike. Another one of our rituals has been LAN party's big and small - from the huge <em>Quakecon</em> to house LAN's. I can&rsquo;t wait to see what fun things hold in our future friendship.</td>

<td width="78%" valign="top"><b>Matt</b> - <i>Groomsman, Tech 4 Unite:</i> Matt and I met during high school in tech theater. Although we weren't initially in the same class during the first year, we spent many hours after school slaving away on the stage sets. Our friendship grew over four years of school, and the many hours spent together let us learn about who we are. I remember riding in the back of Matt's truck on the way to get some more supplies for tech. Ryan called shotgun so I rode in the bed of Matt's truck. This would have been fine if it weren't for the large dips at sixty miles an hour on the tollway which was under construction. In particular I remember one bump we hit - it flung me straight up from the bed and high up over the roof of the cab! Although it was an awesome weightless experience, it nearly scared the poo right out of me. By the end of our four years in high school we became close enough we would have what we called "Bible Classes" where we would talk about life and the bible and what we agreed with and what we didn't. This type of bonding is rare - where you can easily talk to someone about such a sensitive topic and get up from the conversation and still have a best friend in the end. Years later, we don't get to talk as much since we live in different cities but I know if I ever have a problem, he'll pick up the phone. One of our favorite memories with Matt was when Brittany was working in Galveston and we joined Matt for dinner one night in Houston. At the end of the night Matt hugged Brittany goodnight and apparently told her in a very serious, protective voice, "You take care of Kenneth, Ok?"</td>

<td width="78%" valign="top"><b>Ryan</b> - <i>Groomsman, Tech 4 Unite:</i> Ryan and I are the most alike - we met in high school and hit it off  instantly though we did have our little run ins (including a wrench  throwing fit). We had many amusing days in and out of high school and  college including laughing fits in Texas History, strange rambling  stories on the way back home from the mall, "Denton county sheriff" and  so on. We have both been there for each other over the past twelve years  and would do anything at the drop of a hat for the other. We often  don't have enough free time to do the manly bonding as Brittany calls  it, but we know nothing can get in the way of our friendship and  loyalty. A couple of years ago I moved to San Diego to be closer to  Brittany and although he didn't say it, I knew Ryan was a little angry  to miss out on a friend. Ryan's daughter was born a few years ago and  sadly I wasn't able to be there (I wanted to so badly!). McKenzie has  played a huge part in my life and even she goes along with our  shenanigans (if she could teach Brittany to that would be great!). Even  though McKenzie does not like our nicknames, she's my little niece  "Kenzicle" and I am her uncle "Kenifer". I would do anything for the  both of them and I trust they would do the same for me.</td>

<td width="78%" valign="top"><b>JD</b> - <i>Groomsman:</i> JD and I met sophomore year of high school in AutoCAD class. Throughout the year there were different teachers so most of the class was free time. We had a good time playing computer games and talking about cars. Next year, we had class together as well and we continued to grow our friendship. After high school JD stayed in Carrollton but was going to college in Arlington - this allowed us to hang out on nights and weekends. We would hang out frequently because of our mutual interests in cars, firearms and cigars. JD was the first one of my friends to meet Brittany. One day she came into town and even though she was a mess from her road trip home to Dalllas junior year of college, I took her out to What-A-Burger for a strawberry shake. It was pretty late and I thought we wouldn't run into anyone I knew there, but JD was driving by and saw my car so he stopped in to say Hi. He found Brittany and I sharing this huge shake and stopped to talk. One weekend JD, Brittany and I drove out to Fort Worth to a gun show. The three of us walked around looking at everything. It was great to share with Brittany one of the things that brought JD and I together as friends. Brittany likes when I hang out with JD for what she calls "Man Dates" since I don't get out too much.</P></td>
